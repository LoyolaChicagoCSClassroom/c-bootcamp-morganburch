Essentially my work log: 
3/18/24
--tried to successfully link glib library to make hastable work
   (it didnt) 
-- edited cmake and reorganized code
-- will try to get UI working tomorrow 


3/17/24
-- hashtable files pretty much done I think

TODO 
-- create main file for user interface
-- test hashtable efficacy

3/16/24
-- workflows successfully set up 

-- DONE: add stack commands to hashtable
-- TODO: add forth commands and responses like . .s ? ok etc. 


3/12/24 
-- have header and c files for hashtable 
.c file should create the hash tbale and add all relevant forth tokens paired with existing function calls 
main file should process tokens from stdin and check hashtable to call funcitons if tokens match
